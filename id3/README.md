# ID3 Algorithm

Decision tree formation using ID3 Algorithm. An example that uses ID3 Algorithm to classify if a car is fast. Given the attributes Engine, SC/Turbo, Weight, and Fuel Eco, you can classify the car to be fast or not.

ID3 Algorithm is used to build decision trees. This is a form of knowledge representation. Unlike the others in which the rules are stored as separately.
